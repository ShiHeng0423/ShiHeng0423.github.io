<!-- About Intro -->
<section id="about-intro">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I’m a <strong>gameplay programmer and technical designer</strong> who enjoys working under the hood of games —
        building the systems, tools, and moment-to-moment interactions that make a world feel responsive and alive.
    </p>
</section>

<!-- About Content -->
<section class="about-content">
    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            My main focus is turning design ideas into solid, shippable systems. I like thinking about how combat flows,
            how AI should react, how data should be structured, and how all of that fits into a clean game-state and
            architecture that the whole team can rely on.
        </p>

        <p>
            I work across <strong>Unity, Unreal, and custom C++/OpenGL engines</strong>, and I enjoy both gameplay work
            (controllers, abilities, enemies, encounters) and building tools that make iteration faster for designers and artists.
            Whether it’s wiring up a prototype quickly or polishing a feature for a milestone, I care a lot about feel,
            clarity, and helping the team move faster.
        </p>

        <p>
            Long-term, my goal is to help create game worlds where people from very different backgrounds can still find
            something they genuinely enjoy together — whether that’s a mechanic, a story beat, or just a really satisfying fight.

<!-- Education / Background -->
<section>
    <h2 class="text-contrast">Background</h2>

    <div class="about-text">
        <p>
            I’m currently studying game development, where I’ve worked on everything from
            low-level engine programming to higher-level gameplay features. This includes building
            a custom C++/OpenGL engine for a 2.5D arena shooter, co-leading a cooperative action game,
            and experimenting with AI, tools, and level-flow systems in various prototypes.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve also completed an internship in the game-education space, creating Unity projects that
            integrate micro:bit hardware for classroom use. Across team projects, solo work, and internships,
            I’ve grown comfortable moving between design discussions, debugging sessions, and hands-on implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of development, I enjoy dissecting games, watching how different players approach the same
            problem, and sketching ideas for systems or encounters that could make those moments even more fun.
