        <h1>FYP @ NYP (Nov 2020 – Feb 2021)</h1>
        <p>During my Final Year Project at Nanyang Polytechnic, our team worked on two major tasks in parallel while ensuring the project stayed organised and on track.Due to NDA reason, I can't disclosed on what exactly we did but a more summariesed version.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Completing and polishing a client-based project:</strong>
            <br>We focused on refining and finalising the project for delivery. This included reviewing updated assets, tracking changes, maintaining consistency across files, and ensuring all documentation remained accurate. These tasks reinforced the importance of proper organisation, clear version control, and structured workflows during development.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Kickstarting a new in-house game IP:</strong>
            <br>At the same time, we supported the early development of a new in-house game project. This experience emphasised clean coding practices, proper commenting, and maintaining clarity within the codebase to support smooth collaboration across the team and handling over to the next batch of student.</p>
        <p>Overall, this FYP helped me strengthen my project scoping, teamwork, and communication skills, especially when balancing multiple development tasks concurrently.</p>
