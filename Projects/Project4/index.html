        <h2>Game Concept</h2>
        <p>A time-based <strong>Grab & Shoot</strong> shooter game where the player uses mass-based projectiles to defeat enemies while trapped in an enclosed arena. </p>
        <p>These projectiles are the enemies themselves. Players must vacuum them using the <strong>GravGrab</strong> ability before firing them.</p>
        <p>Heavier enemies are more difficult to vacuum and reduce shooting range, but they dealhigher damage or may trigger special effects—making them high-risk, high-reward choices.</p>
        <p>Make strategic decisions, use the environment to your advantage, and survive until the timer ends.</p>

        <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Shooter • 2.5D • Top-Down</p>
