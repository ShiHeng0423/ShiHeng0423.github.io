        <h1>My Internship</h1>

        <p>During my internship, I created Unity-based educational content and interactive learning projects that integrated micro:bit hardware. My role involved designing hands-on teaching materials, developing sample projects, and supporting the refinement of classroom-ready resources.</p>

        <p><strong>Unity × Micro:bit Projects:</strong><br>
        • Designed and implemented two micro:bit–integrated Unity projects for teaching and demonstration.<br>
        • Contributed to testing, documentation, and iteration of learning materials.<br>
        • Developed a rhythm game where the micro:bit functions as the game controller.<br>
